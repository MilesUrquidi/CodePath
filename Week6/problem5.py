Write a function delete_tail() that accepts the head of a linked list and removes the last node in the list. Return the head of the modified list.

Note: The "tail" of a list is the last element in the linked list. It is equivalent to lst[-1] in a normal list.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def delete_tail(head):
    pass
Example Usage:

butterfly = Node("Common Butterfly")
ladybug = Node("Ladybug")
beetle = Node("Scarab Beetle")
butterfly.next = ladybug
ladybug.next = beetle

# Input List: butterfly -> ladybug -> beetle
print_linked_list(delete_tail(butterfly))
Example Output:

Common Butterfly -> Ladybug
